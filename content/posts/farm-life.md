I spent a full day at the farm at [Asia Scenic Thai Cooking School](https://www.asiascenic.com/). I cooked 6 Thai dishes that included: laab, pad see ew, tom sab soup, massaman curry, spring rolls, and the ultra-delicious mango sticky rice. Cooking is not my primary skill, so I was looking forward to learning and eating good food.

As many great chefs and cooks know, the hard part of cooking is the preparation. The company took care of everything and made it really easy to throw ingredients into a skillet and watch it cook. We did get to smash our own curry together using a mortar and pestle, which was fun.

I shared the class with 3 older western couples. They were nice, and one guy from the states was talking my ear off about philosophy, the state of the world, and such.

Our guide Le, was perfect and helped me a lot. I needed it. She kept me on track. I was surprised to learn this was only her second time leading the class. There were no signs of weakness in her direction.

This was my last adventure in Thailand. Up next: Australia!
