Now on to something I‚Äôve been looking forward to for a while, a 3-hour motorbike ride up north, through the mountains, up to Pai. This trek was recommended to me by two friends (separately) who didn‚Äôt ride themselves, but said the journey was incredible with all the views and nature. They were not wrong.

I did my own research before going and the road is famous for its many switchbacks and sharp turns. It‚Äôs described as dangerous and novice bikers should not be doing this as a first-time ride. I don‚Äôt consider myself a novice after riding my good ‚Äòol Honda Metropolitan back in the scoot scoot days at Virginia Tech.

Everything went smoothly and I had an absolute blast on this expedition. There was little traffic and I had no problems cruising through the mountainous jungle. The weather was perfect so I was happy I waited an extra day to do it. It was freeing and I now understand motorcyclists a lot better.

Along the way, there were many viewpoints. I only stopped at one because I was enjoying riding too much. I stopped at Doi Kiew Lom viewpoint in Huai Nam Dang National Park. The lookout featured vast stretches of jungle backed by mountains on the other side. I sat and rested here and enjoyed the view for a bit before beginning my final descent into Pai.
