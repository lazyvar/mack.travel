Byron Bay [started with](/posts/byron-bay-i) poke bowls and long runs, and ended with espresso martinis and Red Bull vodkas. It's the ebb and flow of life. Let's get into it.

The party started off at [Backyard Byron](https://www.instagram.com/thebackyardbyron/), a hippie's live music bar. I went here with some hostel-mates I met at the rooftop bar. Our group consisted of two German girls and an American guy who was born in Mexico and speaks fluent German. Confusing, right! He just graduated from Virginia Tech. Go Hokies! Small world.

The German girl that led us to this bar was a "hippie in training" (my words). She has moved to Byron somewhat recently and is looking for a job to be a long-term resident. It's hard to tell nowadays, but Byron Bay was once a hippie paradise. Filled with the usual campervans, etc. 

I'm sure you've heard this story before, but Byron has since been heavily developed and home prices are skyrocketing. The hippies were pushed to the outskirts of town, but their presence is still very much felt and there is still a small-town vibe to this legendary beach town.

Afterwards we went to [Saltwater Social Club](https://www.instagram.com/saltwatersocialclub) and I didn't stop dancing for 3 straight hours. Had a blast meeting some local Aussies who were a fun time. I pulled out all the dance moves I had and woke up kinda sore the next day, lol.

I developed an annoying cough due to, I think, the air conditioning unit in the dorm room. There was sand everywhere in the hostel and I think the air-con would shove that shit right into my throat while I slept. I got some medicine from a pharmacy and it helped decently.

It started to rain at this point and since I wasn't feeling well, I decided to see a movie during the day. I watched [The Boy and the Heron](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6587046/) directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the same director of [Spirited Away](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429). Pleasant film. I was the only person in the theater which is a rare experience. I liked it so much that I went and saw it again the next day. Just as good the second time.

That night I met up with a friend who I met in [Noosa](/posts/bounce). Mia introduced me to her friends from uni, Tom and Hannah, and we all went to [The Railway Friendly Bar](https://therailsbyronbay.com/). More dancing. This time to a blues band which was a nice change of pace from club electro music.
