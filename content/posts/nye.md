Somehow 6 weeks have gone by, and it is New Year's Eve in Sydney! I met up with my friend Marius. We met early on the 31st at 8:30 am with friends from his hostel. We were there early because we wanted to get into a good viewing spot. I think it was actually one of the best in the city. We got into the more exclusive one, which stopped accepting people an hour after they opened, which was 11:30 am.

There's not a whole lot to write about the day. We just sat and waited, and played card games... for 12 hours. It was worth it (I guess) to get a sweet photo and see the show from a good vantage point. Don't think I'd do it again, though!

I got some really good shots of the fireworks with the Opera House on the X-T30 II. Everyone also wanted a photo, so I did a little photoshoot for everyone.
