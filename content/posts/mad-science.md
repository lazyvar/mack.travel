Iâ€™ve wrapped up working on GymRats for now. I made substantial commits while I was here, but not nearly as much as I thought I would. The state of the business isnâ€™t where I want it to be, but there is still positive growth and potential. Still averaging 1k sign-ups per day and continuing to see the app be essential for certain use cases. Iâ€™ve discovered some [incredible, groundbreaking research](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/11/231102162557.htm) related to the app that could blow things wide open. Exciting things ahead on that front.

I attribute the slip-up to a couple of things, but it was probably inevitable based on my setup. The slow start and food poisoning incident sent me into a panic. I was here three weeks and I hadnâ€™t gotten anything done. So I went into overdrive and worked and worked and worked. This imbalance of course wonâ€™t last long and I knew that, but I just kept thinking I need to put up with it for now and itâ€™ll be good for me later.

What I didnâ€™t account for was that I went slightly mad due to social isolation. It had more of an effect on me than anticipated, which is funny because when I lived alone and worked remotely I experienced this discomfort, but there I was out and about on the weekends and seeing people and such so it wasnâ€™t nearly the same as being in a foreign country 12 time zones away from all who I know and love. Here, the limited interactions I had were at a largely no-talking co-working space and with shop merchants who spoke limited English. The overworking made me tired where I wouldnâ€™t want to socialize anyway.

I am a ginormo introvert and I love my alone time. Itâ€™s just peaceful and nice and blissful. But itâ€™s amazing that I still donâ€™t know that I need people too. I read a [funny blog post](https://www.christopherketcham.com/?p=441) recently talking about this dynamic.

All said, work is over (for now) and onwards to fun in Pai and Australia.
