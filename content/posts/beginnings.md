I've arrived in Chiang Mai and I feel great about what's to come. 2 trains, 3 planes, and 32 hours went by faster than expected. Normally when traveling for vacation I get really excited and have high energy. This time it's different because I have possibly 7 months of travel ahead of me and it's not exactly vacation.

While "excited" is a correct word to use: calm, relaxed, and happy are more accurate. There is plenty of time and I'm not rushin nuthin.

I'll be spending the first couple of days here getting situated. I've rented a Yamaha NMax 2021 from Chloe Motorbike Rentals. I found this place as a recommendation from a YouTube vlogger. It's a Facebook page managed by one person and they deliver the bike to your place of stay. It had good reviews and was pretty cheap so I booked it on the way over. I'm noticing many businesses don't have a website, but just a Facebook page.

I'm writing this at 2:00 am on my first night here. I arrived earlier this day and enjoyed a much needed hot shower and 10 hour sleep. Tomorrow I will have to stay up as late as I can and adjust my circadian rhythm.

Is it a shame that my first meal here had to be McDonald's? It was the only thing open and they had an ATM. The beef was 100% Australian cattle (see picture) and it actually kinda tasted like a real burger unlike the processed stuff back home.

Some realizations I've had in my short time here: I've arrived at the tail end of the rainy season and I didn’t pack any rain gear. Thailand is one of the few countries that drive on the left hand side of the road. I know absolutely zero Thai.
