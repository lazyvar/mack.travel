I've arrived in Chiang Mai and I feel great about what's to come. 2 trains, 3 planes, and 32 hours went by faster than expected. Normally when traveling for vacation I get really excited and have high energy. This is different because I have possibly 7 months of travel ahead of me and it's not exactly vacation. While "excited" is a correct word to use, calm, relaxed, and happy are more accurrate. There is plenty of time and I'm not rushin nuthin.

I'll be spending the first couple of days here getting situated. I've rented a Yamaha NMax 2021 from Chloe Motorbike Rentals. I found this place as a reccomendation from a YouTube vlogger. It's a Facebook page managed by one person and they deliver the bike to your place of stay. It had good reviews and was pretty cheap so I booked it on the way over. I think Facebook is widely used by Thai people and also the world. Interesting that the OG college group has moved far and fast to other services yet Facebook still touts 2.06 billion active users per day. Good thing I haven't deleted it yet I guess.

As expected I am experiencing a different internet than the one I was experiencing at home. There are some subtle differences and some not so much. Google in Abu Dhabi was reading right-to-left instead of the usual left-to-right. It was also in Arabic so that makes sense. When attempting to log into Facebook to check in on my rental, they hit me with a suspicious login attempt which also makes sense. I had planned for this situation by having a home VPN set up so that my IP address reads from my usual spot instead of something unusal. I don't know if I'll actually need to use this, but I thought it would be fun and handy to have. I've read some US banks won't let you login internationally.

On Monday I plan to hit the ground running working on GymRats. That is the primary focus of my time in Chiang Mai and I've put myself on a tight deadline. I hope to enjoy the cafes, the food, and the people while here.
