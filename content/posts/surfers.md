Surfers Paradise in the Gold Coast was supposed to be the Mecca. How could it not be with a name like that? Before my travels, this destination was at the top of my list. My expectations were lowered as I met people traveling up the coast and giving this stay a negative review. In actuality, it was fine for what it was, but not what I thought it would be.

I’m not sure what I thought I imagined, but in this Miami-esque clubbing hotspot, all there was to do was beach and club. So that’s what I did. Beach, then club. Beach and club. Beach. Club. It wasn’t a particularly amazing experience. I don’t love going to clubs like these, but I went with the flow. The beach was really nice, though.

My brain has gone to mush. My chess rating has dropped 100 points and I’ve developed a small sore throat. Sentences be hard.

I am looking forward to my next destination, Byron Bay. My fellow travelers have told me this place is the actual Mecca. I hear great things about this for-real surfer's paradise.

I adjusted my travel plans because of this. Originally, I would only be spending 3 days there before going onward to Sydney for Xmas and then Melbourne for NYE. I am now extending my hostel in Byron to 10 days through Xmas, will be in Sydney for NYE, and scrapped Melbourne completely. I like this much better as missing Sydney on New Year's would have been a certified bad move dude.

I am a man with a plan.
