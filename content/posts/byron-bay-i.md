My time in Byron Bay thus far has been mega holistic. I've been running, hiking, doing pilates, reading, biking, and eating all the poke bowls. Drinking good pour over coffee and having a good time relaxing. I've devoured 2 books since I got here and I think I'll get through 4 before I leave.

I haven't made so many friends in this place, but I don't mind. My travels so far have been very extroverted and it's nice to take a break and just hang. The town's motto is "cheer up, slow down, chill out" and I've definitely been doing that. The vibes are super laid back.

I have become friendly with my dorm-mates and I've enjoyed chatting about our days before going to sleep. I made a joke that made the whole room laugh and I was beaming with pride. One of the English girls said that an American has never made her laugh before. Mission accomplished. I can return home a champion.

I'm about ready to return to the states. I've booked my flight back for right after NYE. When I left, my range of time for travel was between 3 and 7 months, so I'm hitting the minimum of that. I have cherished every second of my time abroad, but I like stability and certainty. The solo traveler's life is filled with constant change and transience, which makes everything exciting, but also unnerving (for me).

I am also hungry to get back to work with a newfound energy. The best place for me to do that is at the Haszienda, in the sunroom, Brooklyn by my side, Mom's good food in my belly, and Dad to make fun of when I get bored.

There are 2 weeks left in this epic adventure, with Christmas right around the corner. I wonder what Santa will bring.
