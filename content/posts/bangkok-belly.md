I suppose it was inevitable. And it can happen again, so I'll need to be more careful, but I'm just getting over a miserable bout of food poisoning. Not quite out of the woods yet, but feeling well enough to write.

It started on Thursday, and I think the culprit was the delicious salmon eggs benedict that I had for brunch. Yes, I had breakfast for lunch; it's called brunch. The restaurant was often crowded and looked like a trustworthy place to eat. In hindsight, maybe choosing the dining item that contained both fish and egg wasn't the best choice.

I stopped work early because my stomach wasn't feeling well, and when I got home, I came down with a vicious fever. I didn't get an actual temp, but it was for sure above 100 F. Not a lot of sleep occurred that night, and if there was sleep, it was this weird delusional, horror dream vision thing. I had the classic "I'm so hot right now, yet also freezing" thing going. Yay for me.

The next two days weren't quite as intense as the first night, but still very miserable. I ate very little, but drank a lot of Gatorade and water. I remained bedridden, only getting up to use the bathroom. My toilet has a bidet, which was getting frequent use on full blast. So at least I got to enjoy that.

A minor setback in a long journey. Hopefully, I am feeling mostly back to normal tomorrow. I had planned my next post to be about all the wonderful food I am eating, but I can hardly look at food right now.
