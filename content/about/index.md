Documenting my travels abroad. Posting when I can. Photos are taken with a [Fujifilm X-T30 II](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-t30-ii/) ([XF27mm F2.8 R WR lens](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xf27mmf28-r-wr/)) and an [iPhone 13 Pro](https://www.apple.com/by/iphone-13-pro/). This site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

While traveling I'm building [GymRats](https://www.gymrats.app). [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Swift](https://www.swift.org/), and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) are my loves. [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), [Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/WhatIsCocoa/WhatIsCocoa.html), and [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) are my muses. I work with a 13-inch, M1, 2020 [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/). It is ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.

I'm learning [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language) on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com). I plan to visit [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil) and I hope to be able to converse while I'm there.

*Boraaaaaa*
