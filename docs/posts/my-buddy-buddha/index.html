  <article>
    <p>Today I had originally planned to travel up to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/QA8YQ5Me46gNAvGJ8">Pai</a> and had my hostel booked and everything, but when I awoke, it was a grey and cloudy day. I was looking forward to the drive the most and I decided to wait one more day to get the fun in the sun. Instead, I went on a self-guided Buddhist temple tour.</p>
<p>There are over 300 temples in Chiang Mai, which I think is more than any other place ever? These temples are called ‚ÄúWats‚Äù and can sometimes be so small, just a tiny hut, or sometimes so large, like a church. Anyone is free at any time to just walk in and sit and meditate or pray. Most did not have seats, but the bigger ones did. I popped in my AirPods, put on my favorite lo-fi Spotify playlist for my walk, and visited 6 or 7 of these Wats in Old City.</p>
<p>They all more or less followed the same pattern. There was an entryway and a hall (short or long) that led to a statue or statues of Buddha or other important figures that I did not recognize. There were monks on site, but they were mostly doing their own thing. At one of the Wats, there was a ‚Äúsit and talk to a monk‚Äù program which looked cool, but I did not participate in.</p>
<p>Wat Chedi Luang is the oldest and looked different than the rest. It was more of a large pyramid with stairs that you could (in the past) ascend. Wat Phra Singh is central to Chiang Mai and the biggest. The whole compound was large.</p>
<p>These Wats are all over Thailand and are quite beautiful. It was nice to sit and enjoy.</p>
