  <p style="font-size: 12px; color: gray; margin-top: 0;">thursday, october 5th, 2023</p>
  <article>
    <p>After a week of being in Chiang Mai, I am time zone adjusted and no longer a zombie. This is great news as I was getting upset about it. I kept attempting to stay up until at least 9pm and kept failing and that was not a good feeling. I finally broke through Tuesday after gluing my eyelids open and made a strong determination to push through.</p>
<p>Even though I was waking up in the dead of night, I was still able to do some stuff during the day and enjoyed touring around some.</p>
<p>I got a Thai massage from <a href="https://www.thehomemassageandspa.com/">The Home Massage</a>. There were a couple of options to choose from, but I got a classic Thai massage as I‚Äôve never had one before and I‚Äôve heard great things about them. Also, I‚Äôm in Thailand so I have to. I was not disappointed. The massage was painfully pleasurable. My muscles were relaxed and loose the next day. The therapist used her bones and elbows and all her might and tactfully applied pressure in the right places. My body loved it. I left feeling happily high and wondered what was in the tea they gave me. It tasted great and when I asked about it they told me it was a mushroom tea. Whichever way, I felt good.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve joined <a href="https://www.yellowincubator.com/coworking">Yellow Coworking</a> on a monthly membership. It is ‡∏ø4,290 ($115) per month. I don‚Äôt have a great place to work at home and want to get out anyways. The internet is fast and there are other people there and it‚Äôs a good environment. It‚Äôs very quiet though, almost too quiet. Everyone is focused on their work and there isn‚Äôt much talking or socializing taking place. I think that‚Äôs fine, but would like to talk to some people. They do run a get together every Friday for beers after work which I plan on checking out.</p>
<p>Yellow is located in Nimman, a neighborhood of the city known for chic coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and the such. It‚Äôs a touch more modern than where I am staying and is a 20 minute commute away. I don‚Äôt mind the distance at all, riding to and from there is the best part of my day.</p>
<p>The bike is in action and it‚Äôs so much fun to ride. Driving here entails a whole blog post on its own which it‚Äôs getting later. I am still in the process of getting my license, but decided to ride without it as the fine for that is ‡∏ø1,000 ($30) and well, I need to get from point A to point B. The route is pretty safe as the roads are mostly one-ways and the complicated right turns are done behind an arrowed light.</p>
<p>The food here is amazing and I am amazed. High quality for low cost. You can‚Äôt beat it. I‚Äôve had Thai, Chinese, and Indian cuisine. So good. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KAOSOYNIMMANCNX/">Kao Soy Nimman</a> is a restaurant close to Yellow and is always crowded when I walk by, so I gave it a try. A typical northern Thai dish contains egg noodles, curry broth and usually a choice of meat. I ordered a ‚Äúbig bowl‚Äù that had octopus, shrimp, pork, beef, and a chicken wing.</p>
<p>A bit much for a midday meal, but it was delicious.</p>
