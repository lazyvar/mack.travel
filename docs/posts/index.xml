      <description>I spent a full day at the farm at Asia Scenic Thai Cooking School. I cooked 6 Thai dishes that included: laab, pad see ew, tom sab soup, massaman curry, spring rolls, and the ultra-delicious mango sticky rice. Cooking is not my primary skill, so I was looking forward to learning and eating good food.
As many great chefs and cooks know, the hard part of cooking is the preparation. The company took care of everything and made it really easy to throw ingredients into a skillet and watch it cook.</description>

      <title>pai hole</title>

      <description>I arrived in Pai in the afternoon and I was ready to start the fun. What I knew about Pai is that it is a small, hippie, backpacker’s paradise. Most people end up staying here way longer than anticipated and it’s referred to as “getting stuck in the Pai hole”. I met many people where this was true and it almost happened to me, but I had too rigorous of a schedule that I couldn’t give up.</description>

      <description>Now on to something I’ve been looking forward to for a while, a 3-hour motorbike ride up north, through the mountains, up to Pai. This trek was recommended to me by two friends (separately) who didn’t ride themselves, but said the journey was incredible with all the views and nature. They were not wrong.
I did my own research before going and the road is famous for its many switchbacks and sharp turns.</description>

      <description>Today I had originally planned to travel up to Pai and had my hostel booked and everything, but when I awoke, it was a grey and cloudy day. I was looking forward to the drive the most and I decided to wait one more day to get the fun in the sun. Instead, I went on a self-guided Buddhist temple tour.
There are over 300 temples in Chiang Mai, which I think is more than any other place ever?</description>

      <description>I’ve wrapped up working on GymRats for now. I made substantial commits while I was here, but not nearly as much as I thought I would. The state of the business isn’t where I want it to be, but there is still positive growth and potential. Still averaging 1k sign-ups per day and continuing to see the app be essential for certain use cases. I’ve discovered some incredible, groundbreaking research related to the app that could blow things wide open.</description>

      <description>Whoa, we&amp;rsquo;re halfway there. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been over a month since arriving in Chiang Mai and there&amp;rsquo;s only three weeks left. It&amp;rsquo;s gone by blazingly fast. That might be because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing the same thing every day. It&amp;rsquo;s a coding groundhog&amp;rsquo;s day out here. However, I am happy to report that I went outside and touched some grass.
It was Friday and I realized I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to get done what I thought I would so I took off early and took a trip up to Huay Tueng Thao Reservoir.</description>

      <description>I’ve forgone pursuing the Thai motorcycle license. I got so far as obtaining a certificate of residency and had all my paperwork in order, but when I went to make an appointment, there was a one and a half month wait time to get one. It’s comforting that DMV’s abroad are just like back home. I don’t really get the sense that I needed the license anyways, so for now they’re tryna to catch me ridin&amp;rsquo; dirty.</description>

      <description>I suppose it was inevitable. And it can happen again, so I&amp;rsquo;ll need to be more careful, but I&amp;rsquo;m just getting over a miserable bout of food poisoning. Not quite out of the woods yet, but feeling well enough to write.
It started on Thursday, and I think the culprit was the delicious salmon eggs benedict that I had for brunch. Yes, I had breakfast for lunch; it&amp;rsquo;s called brunch. The restaurant was often crowded and looked like a trustworthy place to eat.</description>

      <description>After a week of being in Chiang Mai, I am time zone adjusted and no longer a zombie. This is great news as I was getting upset about it. I kept attempting to stay up until at least 9pm and kept failing and that was not a good feeling. I finally broke through Tuesday after gluing my eyelids open and made a strong determination to push through.
Even though I was waking up in the dead of night, I was still able to do some stuff during the day and enjoyed touring around some.</description>

      <description>I am still stuck in time zone limbo. It feels like purgatory. I fell asleep too early yesterday and woke up again at 11:00pm. Not happy about that, but feeling optimistic about today&amp;rsquo;s attempt. Because coffee.
I spent these twilight hours reading and learning to play the piano. I&amp;rsquo;ve never given the piano an attempt and am enjoying playing it. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to learn Beethoven&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Für Elise&amp;rdquo;. It is a simpler song to learn because Beethoven made this song for a woman that he was in love with.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in Chiang Mai and I feel great about what&amp;rsquo;s to come. 2 trains, 3 planes, and 32 hours went by faster than expected. Normally when traveling for vacation I get really excited and have high energy. This time it&amp;rsquo;s different because I have possibly 7 months of travel ahead of me and it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly vacation.
While &amp;ldquo;excited&amp;rdquo; is a correct word to use: calm, relaxed, and happy are more accurate.</description>
