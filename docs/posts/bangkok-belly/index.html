    <p>I suppose it was inevitable. And it can happen again, so I&rsquo;ll need to be more careful, but I&rsquo;m just getting over a miserable bout of food poisoning. Not quite out of the woods yet, but feeling well enough to write.</p>
<p>It started on Thursday, and I think the culprit was the delicious salmon eggs benedict that I had for brunch. Yes, I had breakfast for lunch; it&rsquo;s called brunch. The restaurant was often crowded and looked like a trustworthy place to eat. In hindsight, maybe choosing the dining item that contained both fish and egg wasn&rsquo;t the best choice.</p>
<p>I stopped work early because my stomach wasn&rsquo;t feeling well, and when I got home, I came down with a vicious fever. I didn&rsquo;t get an actual temp, but it was for sure above 100 F. Not a lot of sleep occurred that night, and if there was sleep, it was this weird delusional, horror dream vision thing. I had the classic &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hot right now, yet also freezing&rdquo; thing going. Yay for me.</p>
<p>The next two days weren&rsquo;t quite as intense as the first night, but still very miserable. I ate very little, but drank a lot of Gatorade and water. I remained bedridden, only getting up to use the bathroom. My toilet has a bidet, which was getting frequent use on full blast. So at least I got to enjoy that.</p>
<p>A minor setback in a long journey. Hopefully, I am feeling mostly back to normal tomorrow. I had planned my next post to be about all the wonderful food I am eating, but I can hardly look at food right now.</p>
