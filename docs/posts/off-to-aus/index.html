    <p>And we‚Äôre off! To Australia! I would love to go back to the land of smiles and hope to in the future, but for now it‚Äôs ownward to the world down unda'.</p>
<p>It took me 2 flights to get here with a 10-hour layover through the night in Singapore. Changi airport was world class. It featured a free movie theater where I stopped in and watched The Matrix Resurrections. The place was huge. It reminded me of Doha which was also massive. Not sure which one is bigger. I hard a hard time finding a place to sleep and took turns sitting in different uncomfortable chairs. Eventually (luckily) I was able to score a bed thingy in the snooze zone and got maybe 4 hours.</p>
<p>2 police woke me up while I was sleeping, asking for my passport and boarding pass. I had a very American reaction and was pissed off they woke me up. They had big guns with them (I left mine at home) so I obliged and sleeply handed them what they asked for. I wasn‚Äôt who they were looking for, but they may have found their cuplrit with the guy next to me. They took him somewhere. Not in cuffs though, it looked like a happy thing, I guess.</p>
<p>On my flight from Singapore to Cairns, I sat next to a Australian woman and we chatted for most of the trip. I like talking to the people I sit next to on a plane. It rarely happens, but it‚Äôs nice when it does. She was coming from Spain after completing The Camino de Santiago which is sort of a walking pilgramage thing as far as I understand. We exchanged cultures and I got a taste of what‚Äôs to come. Australians are happy, fun, and positive people. We played the classic game of <a href="https://gametable.org/games/dots-and-boxes/">dot&rsquo;s and boxes</a>. Obviously I won, don‚Äôt really need to explain that.</p>
