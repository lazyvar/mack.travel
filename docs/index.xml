      <description>I am still stuck in time zone limbo. It feels like purgatory. I fell asleep too early yesterday and woke up again at 11:00pm. Not happy about that, but feeling optimistic about today&amp;rsquo;s attempt. Because coffee.
I spent these twilight hours reading and learning to play the piano. I&amp;rsquo;ve never given the piano an attempt and am enjoying playing it. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to learn Beethoven&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;F√ºr Elise&amp;rdquo;. It is a simpler song to learn because Beethoven made this song for a woman that he was in love with.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in Chiang Mai and I feel great about what&amp;rsquo;s to come. 2 trains, 3 planes, and 32 hours went by faster than expected. Normally when traveling for vacation I get really excited and have high energy. This time it&amp;rsquo;s different because I have possibly 7 months of travel ahead of me and it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly vacation.
While &amp;ldquo;excited&amp;rdquo; is a correct word to use: calm, relaxed, and happy are more accurate.</description>

      <description>Documenting my travels abroad. Posting when I can. Photos are taken with a Fujifilm X-T30 II (XF27mm F2.8 R WR lens) and an iPhone 13 Pro. This site is hosted on GitHub pages, using hugo.
While traveling I&amp;rsquo;m building GymRats. Elixir, Swift, and Kotlin are my loves. Phoenix, Cocoa, and Compose are my muses. I work with a 13-inch, M1, 2020 MacBook Pro. It is ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.
I&amp;rsquo;m learning Portuguese on Duolingo.</description>
